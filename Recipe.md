1. Line a 9in springform pan with parchment paper and set aside.

2. Keep a medium size bowl in the fridge so it is cold when it is needed to whip the heavy cream.

3. In a bowl, add the graham cracker crumbs and sugar and mix well. Add the melted butter and mix until its well coated and resembles a sandy texture.

4. Add the graham crackers mix to the springform and spread around well. Then using a clean cup, press it firmly to the pan using the bottom of the cup.

5. Refrigerate the crust until you are ready to add the filling.

6. In a big bowl, add the cream cheese and beat well, using an electric beater, until its smooth.

7. Then add the powdered sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest (if using) and vanilla essence and beat well until its well combined. Keep aside.

8. Wash clean the electric beaters and **dry them well**.

9. Add the heavy cream to the cold, refrigerated bowl. Beat them well, for a couple of minutes, with an electric beater until stiff peaks form. Be careful not to overbeat the heavy cream else will turn to butter.

10. Add the whipped cream in 2 batches to the cream cheese mixture. Fold it well until whipped cream is well blended into the mixture. Do not beat it. 

11. Now add the cream cheese mixture to the cold crust and level it with an offset spatula or a cake smoother to get an even top.

12. Tightly cover the springform pan with foil and refrigerate overnight.

13. Before removing the springform, run a knife around the edges of the pan to release the cheesecake.

14. Serve the cheesecake with fresh berries and / or berry compote.

15. Enjoy!
